    <p>Hey! This is the about page, which is about us - the creators!<br>
      The masterminds behind this one-of-a-kind game are Eliana, Preyanka, Amrita, Cynthia, and Nicole. 
      Our game is a dating simulator, but not just any dating simulator. It's one where you have the 
      opportunity to go on a date with the one and only Gru from Despicable Me. On your date, Gru 
      will ask you a series of questions where we will provide with two options. He will then ask you 
      another question depending on the option you chose. Once all questions are answered, Gru will 
      either fall in love with you or simply reject you based on the options you chose. We hope you 
      have fun playing our game! And remember to choose wisely otherwise your chances of love will be 
      zero to none. Good luck!</p>
